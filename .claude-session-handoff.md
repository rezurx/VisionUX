# Session Handoff - Progress Tracking Discussion

## Context
User wants persistent progress tracking across Claude Code sessions that works automatically "as we go" rather than just at session end.

## Discussion Summary
- Explored TodoWrite tool (real-time task tracking during sessions)
- Discussed broader project understanding persistence
- Need solutions for both immediate progress and architectural knowledge

## Next Steps
1. Implement enhanced TodoWrite that auto-saves to `.claude-progress.json`
2. Analyze codebase to create comprehensive project understanding document
3. Consider broader memory solutions (MCP plugins, git hooks, etc.)

## Current Project State
- Branch: master (clean)
- Recent: Phase 1 Complete, Production Ready Multi-Method Platform
- Has: CLAUDE.md foundation

## To Continue
Pick up with implementing persistent progress tracking solutions.
