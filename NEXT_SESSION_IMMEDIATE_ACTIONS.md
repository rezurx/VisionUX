## ðŸŽ¯ **Primary Goal: Begin Phase 2 Development**

With Phase 1 successfully completed and deployed, the next session priorities focus on Phase 2 AI integration and advanced research capabilities.

### **Phase 2 Development Priorities**

1. **AI-Powered Cross-Method Analysis**
   - Implement machine learning patterns across survey + card sort + accessibility data
   - Create intelligent insights that connect findings across research methods
   - Build recommendation engine for research method selection

2. **Video Analysis Engine (Morae Replacement)**
   - Integrate OpenAI Whisper API for transcription
   - Implement MediaPipe for facial expression and gesture analysis
   - Build collaborative video tagging and annotation system
   - Create automated highlight generation

3. **Advanced Analytics Dashboard**
   - Prototype testing with heatmap generation
   - Behavioral analytics with emotion analysis
   - Real-time collaboration features with WebSocket integration
   - Cross-method correlation analysis with statistical significance

### **Technical Stack for Phase 2**
- **AI APIs**: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Whisper API ($0.006/minute)
- **Video Processing**: FFmpeg.js, WebRTC, HLS streaming with Video.js
- **Real-time**: Socket.io for collaborative features
- **Analytics**: MediaPipe (free), advanced D3.js visualizations
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 or AWS S3 for video/files

### **Success Metrics**
- **Current Performance**: 15.24s build, 1.34MB bundle (363KB gzipped)
- **Target**: AI insights within 2-3 seconds, video processing <30s per minute
- **User Experience**: Seamless cross-method workflows, real-time collaboration

### **Immediate Next Session Actions**

1. **Deploy AI Integration Specialist**
   - Set up OpenAI API integration architecture
   - Design cross-method analysis framework
   - Plan machine learning data pipeline

2. **Deploy Video Analysis Specialist**
