## ðŸŽ¯ **Primary Goal: Resolve All TypeScript Build Errors**

The immediate and only priority for the next session is to fix the series of TypeScript errors that are preventing the production build (`npm run build`) from succeeding.

### **Step-by-Step Plan of Attack**

1.  **Fix the Initial Syntax Error (The Blocker)**
    *   **File**: `src/components/analytics/AccessibilityScorecard.tsx`
    *   **Issue**: A stray closing brace `};` is causing the entire build process to fail at the first step.
    *   **Action**: Remove the extraneous `};` to allow the TypeScript compiler to proceed and report the full list of type errors.

2.  **Address Type Errors Systematically**
    *   Once the initial syntax error is fixed, the build will fail again, but this time with a list of all type errors across the project.
    *   **Action**: Address these errors one file at a time, in the order they appear in the build log. The key files with known issues are:
        *   `src/components/accessibility/AccessibilityAuditCreator.tsx`
        *   `src/components/analytics/DesignSystemMetrics.tsx`
        *   `src/components/accessibility/AccessibilityIssueDetector.tsx`
        *   `src/components/accessibility/AccessibilityScanner.tsx`
        *   `src/components/accessibility/AccessibilityConfiguration.tsx`

3.  **Use a Robust File Writing Strategy**
    *   **Issue**: The `replace` tool has proven unreliable for making multiple changes to the same file.
    *   **Action**: For files with multiple errors (like `DesignSystemMetrics.tsx`), read the file, apply all fixes in memory, and then use the `write_file` tool to overwrite the entire file at once.

4.  **Verify the Build**
    *   **Action**: After fixing all identified errors, run `npm run build` to confirm that the project builds successfully.

## âœ… **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

-   `npm run build` completes without any errors.
-   The `dist/` directory is created, containing the production-ready application.
-   The development server (`npm run dev`) continues to function correctly.

---

## ðŸš€ **POST-FIX ACTIONS**

Once the build is successful:

1.  **Commit the fixes** to the Git repository.
2.  **Test the production build** by running `npm run preview`.
3.  **Deploy the application**.
4.  **Officially mark Phase 1 as 100% complete**.
