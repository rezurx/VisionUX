interface TaskAnalysis {
  primaryDomain: SpecialtyDomain;
  secondaryDomains: SpecialtyDomain[];
  complexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex';
  requiresMultipleAgents: boolean;
  estimatedEffort: string;
  dependencies: string[];
}
```

## Orchestrator Task Routing Logic

### Single-Domain Tasks
```
User Request → Task Analysis → Direct Delegation → Specialist Execution → Quality Check → Response
```

### Multi-Domain Tasks  
```
User Request → Task Analysis → Primary Agent Selection → Supporting Agent Coordination → 
Execution Coordination → Integration → Quality Check → Response
```

### Complex Architecture Tasks
```
User Request → Orchestrator Analysis → Multi-Specialist Consultation → 
Architecture Decision → Implementation Planning → Coordinated Execution → Response
```

## Coordination Patterns

### Sequential Pattern
1. Primary specialist completes core task
2. Secondary specialist builds on output
3. Integration and validation
4. Final response coordination

### Parallel Pattern
1. Task decomposition into independent components
2. Simultaneous specialist execution
3. Output integration and conflict resolution
4. Coordinated response assembly

### Collaborative Pattern
1. Real-time multi-specialist coordination
2. Shared context and decision making
3. Integrated execution with cross-consultation
4. Joint response generation

## Quality Assurance Framework

### Output Validation
- Technical accuracy verification
- Best practice compliance
- Integration compatibility check
- Performance impact assessment

### Context Continuity
- Project context preservation across handoffs
- Consistent architecture and design decisions
- Documentation and knowledge sharing
- Long-term maintainability considerations

## Escalation Procedures

### To Orchestrator
- Conflicting specialist recommendations
- Cross-domain architecture decisions
- Resource allocation conflicts  
- Strategic planning requirements

### To User
- Requirement clarification needed
- Multiple valid solution paths
- Significant scope changes
- External dependency requirements
